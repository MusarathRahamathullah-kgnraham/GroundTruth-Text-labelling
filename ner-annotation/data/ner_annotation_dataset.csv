0,EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb .

2,BRUSSELS 1996-08-22
3,The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .
4,Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .
5,""" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , "" the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing ."
6,He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union .
7,"He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health ."
8,Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .
9,"But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health ."
10,"Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through "" dangerous generalisation . """
11,.
12,Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .
13,The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .
14,"Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste ."
15,"British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe ."
16,""" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , "" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio ."
17,Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .
18,"Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports ."
19,"It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports ."
20,"Rare Hendrix song draft sells for almost $ 17,000 ."
21,LONDON 1996-08-22
22,"A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions ."
23,"A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of "" Ai n't no telling "" , which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966 ."
24,"At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan ."
25,"Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 ."
26,"They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) ."
27,The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27 .

29,BEIJING 1996-08-22
30,China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing .
31,"Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : "" The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . """
32,"State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks ."
33,""" Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ..."
34,"that is to end the state of hostility , "" Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying ."
35,"The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province ."
36,"China , which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien ."
37,China says time right for Taiwan talks .
38,BEIJING 1996-08-22
